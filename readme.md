Exploring microservices utilizing Java 17 + Spring Boot3 + MySQL.

The main idea behind this basic project is to exercise and explore backend programming. 

Download dependencies:
```
mvn clean install
```
Run java application:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

This is still a work in progress and I guess it'll never feel actually finished. This will be used to explore technologies and programming as a whole.
